Steady state real time optimisation using Gaussian processes to model systems

This repository contains MATLAB files for performing real time optimisation using Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process model is created using MATLAB's fitrgp function, and optimised using MATLAB's fmincon function. 

An example script `example_hysys.m </example_hysys.m>`_ is provided to show optimisation performed on the HYSYS file `testing.hsc </testing.hsc>`_.
